# Project Structure

This R project is built in RStudio with the following components:

- A written report in RMarkdown format and its PDF version
- An asset folder containing the data set and a supplementary survey
- A README file that contains ethics statement and briefly introduce the study


# Introduction

This paper studies the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Australianâ€™s overall life satisfaction by comparing the satisfaction scores estimated from the Australian General Social Survey in 2020 and data of the previous years by data visualizations and interpretations with the help of R. We discover that there is a consistent drop in such score among all groups of people in terms of sex, age group, various social and health status. The data also suggests that while people in general still have good faith in their own health and their communities, some groups of people such as non-heterosexual females and people with mental health condition are more vulnerable to the pandemic. We also discuss the survey structure, source of biases, shortcomings and future steps of the study and present an example of an augmented survey that suits the pandemic environment better.


# Data and Reproducibility

The data file is an Microsoft Excel file containing two spreadsheets of estimates and relative standard error of the mean Overall Life Satisfaction Scores aggregated from the 2020 Australian General Social Survey response data. The data is open source at the Australian Bureau of Statistics website, and is used in this study only for academic purpose without any leak of private information.

The data file is the original downloaded data set from online source, and is free of any manual alternation. The report can be entirely reproduced by knitting the RMarkdown document in an R environment with correctly configured dependencies and packages.
